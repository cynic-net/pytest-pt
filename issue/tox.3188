Better warnings when configuration directives in wrong section

### Issue

As a new user to tox browsing through the rather long [Configuration documentation][config], it wasn't entirely clear to me when in the middle of the page which particular section a directive should go in. I set `ignore_base_python_conflict = false` in the `[testenv]` section, but this did not take effect because it should have gone in the `[tox]` section.

I discovered this only because, for other reasons, I happened to be examining the output of `tox config` and noticed some `# !!! unused: ignore_base_python_conflict` lines in it.

It would be nice if tox could emit a warning during test runs in situations like this.

### Additional Documentation Suggestion

Further, it might clarify the documentation somewhat if the ["Core"][core] and ["tox environment"][toxenv] sections made it a bit more clear that each is talking about a different section of the configuration file. For example, after these headings a note could be added along the lines of:

>  __Core__
>
> The following options belong in the `[tox]` section of `tox.ini` or the `[tox:tox]` section of `setup.cfg`.
>
> ...
>
> __tox environment__
>
> The following options belong in the `[testenv]` section of `tox.ini` or `setup.cfg`.

Alternatively, and perhaps better, would be to divide the ["Configuration"][config] page into three: a main page containing the first top-level section and two sub-pages containing the "Core" and "tox environment" sections, respectively.

(I can probably figure out how to submit a patch for the former documentation change; I don't know how to do the latter.)
